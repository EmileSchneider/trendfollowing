# Crypto Trendfollowing
This repo is an attempt at building a fully automated trend following system on crypto. We know that trend
following works and that everything in tradfi works better in crypto.

## Basics
A trend following system consists out of:
- a basket of trend signals
- a portfolio volatility target 

The trend signals we are going to test/use:
- exponential moving average cross over
- breakouts 
- bollinger momentum
- to be expanded...

## Autonomous System
To be a fully automated "fire and forget" system it will require some more components:

Data Storage
Data Connection (with exchanges)
Order Management
Portfolio Management
Risk Management and monitoring
